# Source control

Cogenly integrates with GitHub to clone and publish repositories and create pull requests.
Repositories on other hosts continue to work as plain Git repositories.

## Review turn changes

A turn's changed files and diff show only the turn's own work. When a turn pulls, merges, or
rebases, the files Git brought in are left out. A file stays in the list when the turn edited it,
committed it, or fixed a conflict in it. Use the branch comparison to review everything that changed
against your base branch. Restore still returns the complete saved workspace.

## Connect an account

Install Git and configure authentication on the machine running your Cogenly server. For a remote
environment, do this on the remote machine. After signing in, open **Settings → Source Control**
and choose **Rescan**.

### GitHub

Cogenly talks to GitHub's API directly and only needs a token. Any of these works, in this
order of precedence:

1. A token saved in **Settings → Source Control → GitHub**. It is kept in the server's secret
   store, and works without the GitHub CLI.
2. `GH_TOKEN` (`GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN` with `GH_HOST` for GitHub Enterprise Server) in the
   server's environment.
3. [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) 2.81.0 or newer, signed in with `gh auth login`.

If `gh` is signed in to several accounts or hosts, expand **GitHub** in the same place to pick
the account each host uses or turn a host off. A saved token or `GH_TOKEN` takes precedence
over that choice; a host turned off stays off either way.

For GitHub Enterprise, sign in with `gh auth login --hostname YOUR_HOST`. Cogenly treats a
custom server name as GitHub once it has a credential for that host.

## Start, clone, or publish a project

To start from nothing, choose **New project** in the command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl+K`), or
**New project** under **Add Project** on any client, and type a name. Cogenly makes a Git
repository in `~/.cogenly/projects` (the `projects` folder of your T3 data directory) with a README,
an icon, and a first commit, then opens a new thread in it. Until the project has a thread, new
threads work in its folder, even when your default is a new worktree. The folder is named after the project,
like `pinball-stats` for "Pinball Stats". Turn on **Create private repository on GitHub** to also
publish it. If Git has no name or email on that machine, the project is created without the
first commit.

Use **Add Project** in the command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl+K`) to clone a repository. Choose a hosting
provider or paste a Git URL, then choose where to save it. The project opens right away while the
clone runs in the background: you can write your first prompt, and sending waits until the files
are in place. A toast tracks progress and lets you cancel; if the clone fails, retry it from the
toast or from the banner above the composer.

For a local Git repository without a remote, **Publish Repository** creates a hosted repository,
adds it as `origin`, and pushes your commits. If there are no commits yet, it creates the remote;
make your first commit before pushing.

## Create a pull request

Use a thread's Git actions to commit, push, and create a pull request. Cogenly can generate commit
messages, review titles, and descriptions from your changes.

An existing fork PR can appear beside the branch even if you pushed without setting an upstream.
If its badge is missing because several remotes hold that branch, set the branch's upstream to
the intended remote with `git branch --set-upstream-to=<remote>/<branch>`.

Choose the writing style and model in **Settings → Source Control**. **Repository conventions**
uses the project's instructions and recent commit subjects.

## Pull requests with agents

Ask Claude Code or Codex to inspect or manage a GitHub pull request. Agents can link pull requests to a thread and watch their checks and reviews. Pull request links open through your normal browser preference.
