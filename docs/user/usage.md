# Usage and limits

Open **Usage** from the sidebar or the command palette, or press `mod+u` on web and
desktop when the terminal is not focused. Customize `usage.open` in
**Settings → Keybindings**.

## Understand your usage

When your app and server support different providers, usage totals may cover only the providers
your app understands. Update the app to include newly supported providers.

If recent work is missing or a new model shows no cost, refresh to rescan session history and
update model pricing.

## Track subscription limits

**Usage → Limits** pools every subscription account it can see per provider, so with several Codex
or Claude accounts across your environments and hubs you read one number per window rather than a
list. Each window card shows how much of the pool is left and a bar with one segment per account,
kept in the same column across windows. Accounts are ordered by their 5-hour reset, soonest
first, or by the first available window when no account reports a 5-hour limit. A gap means the
account does not report that window. When the provider reports reset times, the card also says
when the next reset lands and how much it hands back. The hatched
part of a segment is what that reset restores. Tap a segment or account row for the account's plan,
where it is signed in, and its reset time. On web, you can hover too. Codex and Claude accounts
with banked reset credits show a ticket count and the **Use reset** action in the account details.
Claude resets are not available when the server runs on macOS, where Claude keeps its login in the
Keychain. On narrow screens, numbered rows below
the bar show each account's quota, countdown, and credits. Tap a row to open its details.

The same account signed in on more than one environment, or reported by a hub as well, counts once.
Filter with the environment dropdown to see what a single machine has.

Opening Limits checks the selected connected environments automatically. Each client waits at
least five minutes between automatic checks of an environment, including after a failed check.
If a window still looks stale, refresh Limits to re-check every provider and hub.

Pick `/usage-limits` from the composer's command menu, or send it as a message, to check the
current model's limits without leaving the conversation. The result opens above the composer and
closes when you dismiss it or send your next message. It uses the same snapshot as **Usage → Limits**, so it does not run the agent or refresh
anything. The command is offered only for providers that appear under **Usage → Limits**.

API-key accounts may not report subscription limits. This also applies to Claude connections
using a proxy through `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`.

## Connect a CLIProxyAPI hub

To see pooled accounts, open **Settings → Providers → Usage providers → Add hub**. Choose the
environment that will connect to the hub and enter its URL and management key.

The accounts appear under **Usage → Limits**. Codex accounts show banked reset credits; select an
account and choose **Use reset** to redeem one. No hub plugin is required.

This connection supplies usage information; configure
the provider separately to send agent requests through the hub. Remove the hub from the same
settings section when you no longer need it.

## Subscription usage widget

Add **Subscription usage** from your iOS or Android widget gallery to see remaining Codex and
Claude quotas. Tap it to open **Usage → Limits**; on Android this works while T3 is running in
the background, otherwise open the app from the launcher. On iOS, use **Edit Widget** to choose
Session, Weekly, or both for each provider. Reopen T3 to refresh expired readings.

## Keyboard shortcuts

On web and desktop, open Usage from the command palette. While on Usage,
press `C`, `T`, or `L` for Cost, Tokens, or Limits while not typing in a field.
Use `Ctrl+Shift+1/2/3/4` (`Cmd+Shift+1/2/3/4` on macOS) for the past
24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, or 90 days. Period shortcuts do nothing on Limits.
Press `Escape` to return to the previous page. Customize these shortcuts in
**Settings → Keybindings**.
